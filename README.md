## 🎯 Task Management Rules

1. **🚀 Moving Tasks**:

   - 📝 When you start working on a task, move it from the `TODO` list to the `PROGRESS` list.
   - 💡 If you come across a new task while working, go ahead and add it to the `TODO` list.
   - ✅ Once you finish a task, celebrate by moving it from `PROGRESS` to `DONE`! 🎉

2. **🌿 Branch Name**:
   - While working on a task, always create and work on a branch that matches the `branchName` specified in the task. This helps keep everything neat and tidy! 🔖

Let's keep the energy high, communication flowing, and creativity sparking! 🎨 Feel free to experiment, ask questions, and push the boundaries of what we can build. Most importantly, have fun! 😎

**Happy coding!** 💻✨
